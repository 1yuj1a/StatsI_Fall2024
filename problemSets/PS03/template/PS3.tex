\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.
			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=40]{PS3_Lyu_Jia.R}

			Call:
			lm(formula = voteshare ~ difflog, data = df)

			Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
			
			Residual standard error: 0.07867 on 3191 degrees of freedom

			F-statistic:  1853 on 1 and 3191 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
	 	
			The regression analysis reveals that the difference in 
			campaign  spending (`difflog`) explains a moderate 
			portion (36.73%) of the variability in the incumbent's vote 
			share   (`voteshare`). With a R-squared of 0.3673 and an 
			adjusted  R-squared of 0.3671, the model suggests that 
			`difflog` contributes meaningfully to predicting vote share 
			without indicating overfitting. The residual standard error 
			(0.07867) indicates a relatively close fit between observed 
			and predicted values. 
			A highly significant F-statistic (1853, p < 2.2e-16) further 
			confirms the model’s relevance, underscoring `difflog` as 
			a statistically significant predictor of `voteshare`, although
			other factors may also play a role.

\section*{Question 2}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference between incumbent and challenger's spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party are related.	\vspace{.25cm}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{presvote} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.

		F-statistic: 307.7 on 1 and 3191 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
		\end{verbatim}	\begin{verbatim}
		The regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship 
		between the difference in campaign spending (`difflog`) and the incumbent’s 
		vote share (`presvote`). Specifically, for every one-unit increase in    
		`difflog`, the incumbent’s vote share increases  by approximately 
		0.023837 units. The model’s intercept is 0.507583, with both the
		intercept and the slope being statistically significant 
		(p-value < 2e-16). The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is
		0.08795, indicating that about 8.8% of the variation in the incumbent’s
		vote share can be explained by the difference in campaign spending.
		Although the model is statistically significant (F-statistic = 307.7, 
		p-value < 2.2e-16), its explanatory power is limited, suggesting that 
		other factors beyond campaign spending may also influence the incumbent’s 
		vote share.

The regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship 
between the incumbent's vote share, campaign spending difference
(`difflog`), and the president's vote share (`presvote`). A one-unit
increase in `difflog` results in a 0.0355 increase in the incumbent's 
vote share, while a one-unit increase in `presvote` results in a 0.2569  
increase. The model explains 44.96% of the variation in vote share
R-squared = 0.4496), with an F-statistic of 1303 and p-value 
< 2.2e-16, indicating statistical significance. However, other factors 
may still influence the incumbent's vote share.

		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
			\begin{verbatim}
Similarities:
1. Residuals:The statistical data for residuals in both models are identical:
minimum value: -0.25928, first quartile: -0.04737, median: -0.00121,
third quartile: 0.04618, and maximum value: 0.33126.
2. Residual Standard Error:The residual standard errors are nearly
identical (0.07339 and 0.07338), indicating similar model fits.
3. F-statistic and p-value:Both models show significant F-statistics 
and p-values, suggesting they are statistically significant.
		
Reasons:
1. Same Dataset:Both models use the same dataset, resulting in similar
residual distributions.
2. Similar Error Structures:The error terms in both models likely follow
similar distributions.
3. Same Sample Size:The similar degrees of freedom (3190 and 3191)
contribute to comparable residual standard errors.
4. Model Significance:Both models effectively explain the variability in the
dependent variables, supported by significant F-statistics.
5. Linear Relationships: Both models capture linear relationships, leading
to similar residual patterns.
6. Random Error: In large samples, random error can produce similar
residual patterns, even with different models.
